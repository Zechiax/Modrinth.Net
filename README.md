C# Wrapper for the [Modrinth API](https://docs.modrinth.com/)

- For list of supported endpoints,
  see [List of endpoints and their support in this library](#list-of-endpoints-and-their-support-in-this-library)
    - The plan is to eventually cover all endpoints

## Main attributes

- Automatic rate limiting
    - Retry count is configurable
- No dependencies
- Fully documented
- Support for .NET 8.0 and newer

## Usage

- Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Modrinth.Net)

```csharp
using Modrinth;

var options = new ModrinthClientConfig 
{
    // Optional, if you want to access authenticated API endpoints
    ModrinthToken = "Your_Authentication_Token",
    // For Modrinth API, you must specify a user-agent
    // There is a default library user-agent, but it is recommended to specify your own
    UserAgent = "MyAwesomeProject"
};

var client = new ModrinthClient(options);

var project = await client.Project.GetAsync("sodium");

Console.WriteLine(project.Description);
```

But you don't have to provide options at all, you can just create a client with the default options:

```csharp
var client = new ModrinthClient();
```

### User-Agent

- You can also use the UserAgent class to help you create a valid user-agent
- User-Agent currently cannot be changed after the client has been created
- More info about the User-Agent can be found [here](https://docs.modrinth.com/api-spec/#section/User-Agents)

```csharp
using Modrinth;

// Note: All properties are optional, and will be ignored if they are null or empty
var userAgent = new UserAgent
{
    ProjectName = "ProjectName",
    ProjectVersion = "1.0.0",
    GitHubUsername = "Username",
    Contact = "contact@contact.com"
};

var options = new ModrinthClientOptions
{
    UserAgent = userAgent.ToString()
};

var client = new ModrinthClient(options);
```

### Search

- You can search for projects using the `SearchAsync` method, in the `Project` endpoint

```csharp
using Modrinth;

var client = new ModrinthClient(userAgent: "My_Awesome_Project");

var search = await client.Project.SearchAsync("sodium");

foreach (var project in search.Hits)
{
    Console.WriteLine(project.Title);
}
```

#### Search with facets/filtering

- You can filter the search results by using facets, which are a way to filter the results by certain criteria
- You can read more about facets [here](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/tutorials/api_search/#facets)
- You can create a `FacetCollection` and add facets to it, and then pass it to the `SearchAsync` method

Example:

```csharp
// For search with facets, you first need to create a FacetCollection
var facets = new FacetCollection();

// Then you can add facets to it
// You add a facet by calling the Add method on the FacetCollection
// In one call, you can add multiple facets, they will be combined in an OR statement
// If you call Add again, the new facets will be combined in an AND statement with the previous ones

// Example:
facets.Add(Facet.Category("adventure"), Facet.Category("magic"));
facets.Add(Facet.Version("1.19.4"));

// This will create a query that looks like this:
// (category:adventure OR category:magic) AND version:1.19.4
// Basically it will search for projects that have the category "adventure" or "magic" on Minecraft version 1.19.4

// Then you can pass the FacetCollection to the SearchAsync method
var search = await _client.Project.SearchAsync("", facets: facets);
```

As `FacetCollection` implements `ICollection<T>`, you can use collection initializers to add facets to it, like this:

```csharp
var facets = new FacetCollection
{
    { Facet.Category("adventure"), Facet.Category("magic") },
    { Facet.Version("1.19.4") }
};
```

Which will create the same query as the previous example.

### Unsuccesful API calls

- If the API call was unsuccessful, the client will throw an `ModrinthApiException` exception
- This will be thrown if the API call return non-200 status code

```csharp
using Modrinth;
using Modrinth.Exceptions;
using System.Net;

var client = new ModrinthClient(userAgent: "My_Awesome_Project");

try 
{
    var project = await _client.Project.GetAsync("non-existent-project");
    
    Console.WriteLine(project.Title);
}
// You can catch the exception and only handle the 404 status code
catch (ModrinthApiException e) when (e.Response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("Project not found");
}
// Or you can catch the exception and handle all non-200 status codes
catch (ModrinthApiException e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"API call failed with status code {e.Response.StatusCode}");
}
```

## Development

### Testing

Library uses [NUnit](https://nunit.org/) for testing.

To run tests, you can use the `dotnet test` command. To run authenticated tests, you need to set the `ModrinthApiKey` secret for the test project.

You can do this by running the following command in the terminal, in the root of the project:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init --project .\test\Modrinth.Net.Test
dotnet user-secrets set ModrinthApiKey "Your_Authentication_Token" --project .\test\Modrinth.Net.Test
```

If you wish to remove the secret you can run:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets remove ModrinthApiKey --project .\test\Modrinth.Net.Test
```

Optionally, you can also set the `MODRINTH_API_KEY` environment variable, but secrets are preferred.
